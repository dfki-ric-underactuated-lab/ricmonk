# Software Installation
All software has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04. To be able to run all simulation based software, install Drake (Version: 1.18.0) first into 
a python virtual 
environment, as described on the [Drake website](https://drake.mit.edu/pip.html#stable-releases). After activating the venv, install the remaining 
dependecies via:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
