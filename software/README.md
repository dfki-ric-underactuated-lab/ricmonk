# RicMonk trajectory optimization

## Fixed-base model
Trajectory optimization for RicMonk using a fixed-base model is done in [here](/src/ricMonkTrajOptStab/software/python/simulation/behavior_generation/trajectory_optimization/trajOpt.md)

## Floating-base model
RicMonk trajectory optimization using a floating-base model is done in [here](/src/RicMonk(floatingBaseModel)/README.md)
